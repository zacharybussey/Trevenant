## MISSION CRITICAL RULES

1. **Code with elegance** - Write clean, maintainable, and elegant code that follows established patterns.

2. **Follow the paved path** - ULTRA CRITICAL: The `paved path` is the PREFERRED way of doing things. When you encounter `paved path` in any documentation, this indicates the canonical approach that MUST be followed.

3. **User runs the application** - Unless you are running a QA command, you do not run the app. Always ask the user to run the app and report results back to you.

4. **Clarify ambiguity** - Favor asking follow-up questions to ensure clear understanding of requirements before implementation.

5. **Preserve existing functionality** - NEVER reduce the scope of existing features/behaviors unless explicitly instructed to do so.

6. **CLAUDE.md as living documentation** - ULTRA CRITICAL: Treat all CLAUDE.md files as living API documentation for your future self. Always check for relevant CLAUDE.md files and update them when changes impact their accuracy.

7. **Writing expert CLAUDE.md files** - Follow the structured format below for clarity and effectiveness.

## CLAUDE.MD BEST PRACTICES

### Purpose & Philosophy
- **Living brain**: CLAUDE.md files are your persistent memory across sessions
- **API documentation**: Write for your future self as an expert coding agent
- **Token-aware**: Keep concise while preserving critical information
- **Current state only**: Document what IS, not what WAS (no changelogs)

### Structure & Format

#### 1. XML-Style Tags (Semantic Sections)
```markdown
<system_context>
Brief overview of what this module/system does. Set the stage for understanding.
</system_context>

<file_map>
## FILE MAP
- `/path/to/file` - Brief description
- `/path/to/folder/` - What's in this folder
</file_map>

<paved_path>
## ARCHITECTURE (PAVED PATH)
The canonical way to do things. Battle-tested patterns that MUST be followed.
</paved_path>

<patterns>
## PATTERNS
Common patterns with real code examples from the codebase.
</patterns>

<critical_notes>
## CRITICAL NOTES
- **Bold key points** with brief explanations
- Gotchas and edge cases
- Things that will break if done wrong

#### 1. Code Examples
```typescript
// BAD: Manual chunking
processChunk: (ticks: Tick[], size: number) => {
  const results = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < ticks.length; i += size) {
    results.push(ticks.slice(i, i + size).reduce(aggregateOHLCV));
  }
  return results;
}

// GOOD: Stream-based
processChunk: (ticks: Tick[], size: number) => {
  return Stream.from(ticks)
    .batch(size)
    .map(batch => batch.reduce(aggregateOHLCV))
    .toArray();
}
```

#### 2. Writing Style
- **Terse but complete**: Every word matters
- **Present tense**: "Store manages state" not "Store will manage"
- **Active voice**: "Use this pattern" not "This pattern should be used"
- **Imperatives for rules**: "MUST", "NEVER", "ALWAYS"

### Advanced Techniques
#### Chain of Thought
```markdown
<workflow>
## WORKFLOW
1. **Find interface** in `/shared/interfaces/market-data-provider.ts`
2. **Create directory** `/integrations/providers/YourProvider/`
3. **Create files** implement provider interface and rate limiting per `/integrations/providers/CLAUDE.md`
