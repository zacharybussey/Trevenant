# Removing the fixed levels

The VGC calc we started from has a couple settings to fix the levels to 50 and 100.  The idea beind this is that is how competitive VGC works.  However, if you are trying to do a Nuzlock, that system does not work at all.  What it should be doing is tracking the levels of the party and using these.  And then, once we get to it, using the levels of the oppoents from the games.

So, the current inputs for setting the levels should be removed so that the values from two calc inputs can be used instead.
